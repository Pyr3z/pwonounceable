# pwonouncable
(CLI) tools for generating human-pronounceable passwords.

## How use?
So far the only tool here is **3pw** â€” based off of [Tom Van Vleck's `gpw` program](https://multicians.org/thvv/gpw.html).
1. If you have `gcc` and `bash` handy, you should be able to build by simply running `./make.sh`.
 - Everything here is ANSI C compliant, so you _should_ also be able to compile virtually any other compiler.
2. Run the built binary from any TTY.
3. Current optional arguments are documented in the header of the main `3pw.c` file.
